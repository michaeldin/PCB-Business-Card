##  Features
- PCB size: **90 mm Ã— 50 mm**   
- Power: **CR2032 coin cell**  
- Components:
  - `74HC08` â€” AND gates  
  - `74HC32` â€” OR gates  
  - `74HC74` â€” D flip-flops  
  - `NE555` â€” 1 Hz clock generator  
  - 7-segment-style LED arrangement to visualize digits  
- Integrated **QR code** with my contact information  

---

##  How It Works
- The **NE555 timer** generates a ~1 Hz clock signal.  
- The clock drives the **4-bit counter (made of 4 DFFs)**, which increments automatically.
- Combinational logic (using logic gates) manipulate the counter output to show my phone number.
- The output is displayed using discrete LEDs arranged as digits.

feel free to use, modify, and build your own logic business card.
