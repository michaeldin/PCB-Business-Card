# Logic Gate Business Card

![Business Card Front](Photos/front.jpeg)



A fully functional **PCB business card** that demonstrates digital logic design using discrete ICs.  
This card integrates **AND, OR, gates, D flip-flops and an NE555 clock generator** â€” all powered by a single CR2032 coin cell.  
It is not just a card, but also an **interactive logic demo** you can carry in your pocket.

## âœ¨ Features
- PCB size: **90 mm Ã— 50 mm** (standard business card size)  
- Power: **CR2032 coin cell**  
- Components:
  - `74HC08` â€” AND gates  
  - `74HC32` â€” OR gates  
  - `74HC74` â€” D flip-flops  
  - `NE555` â€” 1 Hz clock generator  
  - 7-segment-style LED arrangement to visualize digits  
- Integrated **QR code** with my contact information

## ðŸ§© How It Works
- The **NE555 timer** generates a ~1 Hz clock signal.  
- The clock drives the **4-bit counter (made of 4 DFFs)**, which increments automatically.
- Combinational logic (using logic gates) manipulate the counter output to show my phone number.
- The output is displayed using discrete LEDs arranged as digits.
